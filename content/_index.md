## About Us

We celebrate experimental learning while exploring new partnerships. We are artists, students, scientists, farmers, entrepreneurs, and interested members of the community who meet to discuss, play, learn, and seek new solutions for the issues of our day. **We are a place where everyone is welcome.**
