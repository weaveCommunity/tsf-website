## About Us
**The Soil Factory** is a vibrant community space where art, science and sustainability come together to create new collaborations, new experiences and new ideas organized by [WeaveCommunity](https://weavecommunity.org). We celebrate experimental learning while exploring new partnerships. We are artists, students, scientists, farmers, entrepreneurs, and interested members of the community who meet to discuss, play, learn, and seek new solutions for the issues of our day. **We are a place where everyone is welcome.**
