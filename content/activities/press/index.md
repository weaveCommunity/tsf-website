Some of these can be obtained through The Soil Factory, whereby some of the proceeds will go to the artists, some to The Soil Factory that hosted and facilitated the projects, and some constitute handling fees to ship the publication to you.

The Soil Factory Review is an irregular publication by The Soil Factory Press on topics and with projects of interest to the Soil Factory community. Past and planned Reviews:  

The Soil Factory Review #1: The Soil Factory Manifestos  

The Soil Factory community got together in early 2025 to recite from the rich history of existing manifestos to start composing our own Soil Factory manifestos and recite them in a public event in May 2025. The 26 manifestos exist only as a handful of multiples either written by the authors, copied by others in their own handwriting or the handwriting of the original authors, mostly done during communal events (as shown in the header photo). At the moment, 6 copies exist, no electronic copy exists, it cannot be purchased, but you can read it by visiting The Soil Factory in person and open a door at the back of the great hall, - enjoy\!

Description of The Soil Factory Review \#1: “An aspiration or proposition, bound in clay or iron or wood, written by many different people”
