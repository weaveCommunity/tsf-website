The Craft Studio is an open workshop space that hosts Craft Jams, which include sewing machines, a serger, mending circle, block printing, clothing swap, and a fabric scrap library. The Jams are hosted bi-weekly and are free-flowing evenings in which the machines are open for use, and mending materials are available in an unstructured work environment. Co-managers are present to help orient folks to the space and chat about projects, but skillsharing comes from within the community.  

Regular additions to Craft Jams include the Linocut Station for block printing jams, and Clothing Swaps where clothes are both swapped and mended, along with a variety of other craft related workshops. One-off special events we have hosted include:
 - Kozo papermaking workshop with Adam Bryan and Laura Rowley
 - Pants Fitting workshop with Ruth Collins 
 - Land-Heritage Black Walnut Foraging and Fabric-Dying workshop with Sheila Novak
 - Magick Sigil Embroidery with Artist-in-Residence Franz Bazin 

All of our Jams, Workshops and Special Events are publicized through the newsletter and on the calendar. Attend an event to join the newsletter!

## Static Spaces

{{< alt-image src="img/img2.jpg" >}}
**Leftover Sewing Laboratory**  
The Leftover Sewing Lab is a spinoff from an artist collective developed in 2018 in Berlin that revolved around bringing sewing machines and scrap together to have impromptu making sessions turning out sculptures, costumes and play materials. Upcycling textiles and open structured play are the driving forces behind Leftover Sewing. We continue to host this DIY space at the Soil Factory Craft Studio to provide guidance and advice on how to use sewing machines as a tool in your crafting vocabulary.

**Make Mends Meet // MENDING CIRCLE**  
Established by Kathrin Achenbach, our mending circle is a continuation of her Make Mends Meet model. We invite folks to slow down and sit with us in the living room at the Soil Factory to learn hand stitches, and mend garments to give them new life. Kathrin instilled in us the spirit that mending is a radical act, focusing on slow crafting as community building, and giving new life to clothes that would otherwise go into landfills.  
*Hosted by the community*

**Linocut**  
The craft studio is home to a linocut station where art-makers can design and learn the meditative process of carving stamps. We provide inks, carving tools, and carving media such as upcycled linoleum flooring. Participants can use their stamp to make prints on a variety of donated papers, textiles, and clothing!

**Clothing Swaps**  
Clothing Swaps are special events, hosted in conjunction with Craft Jams when the seasons change or the Soil Factory community calls for one. Swaps do not occur as one-to-one trades and you do not need to bring clothing in order to participate. Rather well-loved clothes are pooled and find new homes.  
*Hosted by Shay and Joey*
