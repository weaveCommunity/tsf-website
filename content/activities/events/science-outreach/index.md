The Soil Factory is an organization funded in part by scientific grants, and many of the scientists who engage with the community are interested in educating and engaging with the research we do in our day-to-day basis. In that spirit we are starting a series of outreach events, aiming to start with one a month, which will bring people together to discuss the topics which that funding makes possible. This series will focus on agriculture, climate science, and artificial intelligence, and possibly more depending on interest.

If you have questions or would like to propose a topic you'd like to know more about, or contributing your own work to at one of these events, please contact [Jacob Boes](mailto:jrb226@cornell.edu).

### Events:

{{< alt-image src="img/event1.webp" >}}
**Demystifying AI in the Age of Climate Change**  
February 20th, 6:00pm-7:30pm

Interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) but don't know how it works? How is it useful and how it isn't? Join us for a series of events where we will discuss these questions as a group under the direction of a professional with 7 years of collective experience working on ML implementations for renewable energy materials. 

For our first meeting, February 20th, we will be collecting feedback from the group about your conceptions of AI and going over the fundamentals of how most AI models operate to give you a sense of what AI is useful for, and what is hype. Also, come and give us feedback on what you’re interested in knowing more about. Your questions will shape what we cover in future sessions. There will be snacks!

_Agenda_  
6:00 - 6:10pm : Settling in, introduction and agenda.  
6:10 - 6:35pm : Group breakout: what is AI? Expectation of its capabilities?  
6:35 - 7:00pm : An expert’s view: The fundamentals that tie AI implementations together.  
7:00 - 7:20pm : Group breakout: Revisiting expectations for AI.  
7:20 - 7:30pm : Wrapping up, requests for topics in future sessions.
